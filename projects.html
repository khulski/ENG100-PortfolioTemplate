	<h3>Women In Computer Science Online Code Editing Website</h3>
	The WCS "Tech Team" group developed a coding interview website designed for online technical interviews. This 
	website has several elements that will facilitate the process of a technical interview such as chat supporting input via text, video and audio as well as a "live" coding box. I was a part 
	of the group implementing the coding box where I worked with Javascript, HTML and CSS to implement syntax 
	highlighting, bracket matching, etc.
